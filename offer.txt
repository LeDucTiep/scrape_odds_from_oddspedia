Hi We need a scraper, that frequently scrapes odds from the website www.oddspedia.com. 
1. You go back one day (click on previous day) 
2. All those games are finished and can be scraped. 
3. Iterate through all games. On a game: click on "ODDS" and "Live odds". You see many bookmakers. 
Set the country to "Switzerland" and click on "show all bookmakers" 
4. you now see many bookmakers. click on the blue symbol, so that the timestamp/odd history plot pops up. 
from that plot, we need ALL data. so for HOME, DRAW, AWAY we need all odds with corresponding timestamp. 
Do this for all bookmakers (or include in the script that we can specify one). 
5. Also, we need game information, such as team names, result, starting time. This is part 1 of the project. 
After that, I have other milestones where we build up on the results.
 We will scrape often and append data (check for duplicates etc.).
 All the data should be saved as .csv Please be aware. 
 If there is a API or similar that we can use, please do that. 
 That's why I am looking for an expert. I think the task itself is not very difficult. 
 We MIGHT encounter difficulties with getting banned. In that case I need someone with experience in proxies etc. 
 I am looking forward, please show me that you exactly get what data I need with an example :) 
 API, proxy, more milestones
